                Tennis is a sport in which participants compete against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player hits a hollow rubber ball covered in felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court with a racket attached with a cord. The goal of the game is to play the ball in a way that prevents the opponent from making a successful return.
