                Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport in which two teams of 11 players compete on a field with a rectangular 22-yard pitch in the middle. Batting alternates between the two contending sides in an attempt to score runs. The opposite team fields while one team bats. An innings is the unit of measurement for each turn. Tests, One-Day Internationals, and Twenty-20 Internationals are the three different formats of cricket.

Today, cricket is especially popular in Australia and the United Kingdom, but people of all ages around the world enjoy playing in leagues and tournaments.
