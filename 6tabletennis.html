                Table Tennis, often known as ping pong, is a sport in which two or four players use table tennis rackets to strike a lightweight ball back and forth. The game is played on a hard table with a net separating the players. Except for the initial serve, players must let only one bounce on their side of the table for a ball hit towards them before returning it to the opposite side.
