                Associate Football, often known as soccer or football, is a sport in which two teams of eleven players compete with a spherical ball. It is the most popular sport in the world, with 250 million players in over 200 countries. A rectangular field with a goal at each end is used to play the game. The purpose of the game is to get the football into the opposition goal using any part of the body other than the arms and hands. Only goalkeepers are permitted to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play, and only within their own penalty area.

In ancient China, around the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE, people played the first known ball game called Cuju with a leather ball filled with feathers. In ancient Greece and Rome, people also played ball games, although not in major events like the Panhellenic Games.
