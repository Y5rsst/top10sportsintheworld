                    American football (also known as football in the US and gridiron in other countries) is a sport in which two teams of eleven players compete on a rectangular field measuring 120 yards long by 53.3 yards wide with goalposts at both ends. The offense uses either running or passing to move an oval ball (the football) down the field. To receive a new set of four downs and continue the drive, they must progress it at least 10 yards in four downs; otherwise, the ball is turned over to the other team.

                    In the United States, it is extremely popular. In the majority of countries, professional American football leagues do not exist. The sport's sole well-known league is based in the United States. The Super Bowl is the most important sporting event in the United States. It is the annual National Football League Championship Game, which pits the winners of the National and American Football Conferences against one another.
