                Basketball is a sport played on a rectangular court by two teams of five players. The goal is to shoot a ball through a hoop with a diameter of 18 inches (46 cm) and a height of 10 feet (3.0 m) mounted on a backboard at each end. During ordinary play, a team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket. If a player is touching or closer to the hoop than the three-point line on a field goal, the shooting team receives two points, and three points if the player is below the three-point line. At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins.
