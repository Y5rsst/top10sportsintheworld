                With 2-2.2 billion supporters across Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and other parts of the world, hockey [field + ice] is the world's third most popular sport. It is a group of sports in which two teams compete by attempting to maneuver a ball or puck into the opponent's goal with the use of a hockey stick. One sport, either field hockey or ice hockey, is commonly referred to as hockey in numerous areas. Hockey is popular all throughout the world in both forms.
                <br><br>
                Hockey has its origins in 18th century England. Over time, different types of hockey developed as people created their own versions of the game. Some well-known examples include field hockey (played on grass or turf), street hockey (played on asphalt or concrete), and roller hockey (played on roller skates).
                <br><br>
                Ice hockey began in Canada and quickly became the most popular form of hockey in Canada, the U.S., Scandinavian countries, and Eastern Europe. On the other hand, field hockey remains very popular in South Asia, South America, and parts of Central Europe.
                <br><br>
                Although underappreciated in certain areas, field hockey has a committed fan base of 2 billion people. Field hockey is a popular sport in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, known for its fast-paced action and technical skill. It also has a prominent presence in the Olympic Games, which strengthens its global significance.
                <br><br>
                The National Hockey League (NHL) in the United States is the world's most popular hockey league. The World Cup of Hockey is the most important competition in field hockey. In the Olympics, both ice hockey and field hockey are popular sports.
