                Volleyball, which originated in America, is projected to have 900 million fans worldwide. The sport is popular in Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Americas, and can be played inside or outdoors. Volleyball is becoming increasingly popular across the world, with over 220 associated national federations registered with the Fédération International de Volleyball (FIVB). The event is held every four years and involves 24 countries.

                Volleyball is an extremely simple game with little equipment and few rules. All you need is a ball and a net. It was introduced in the Olympic Games back in 1964 and its beach variation was a real kick starter for its rapid growth in popularity around the world.
                <br><br>
                Volleyball is a team sport in which a net separates two teams of six players. Under regulated regulations, each team aims to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court.

                All sports have national federations, but volleyball has the most. These federations frequently organize professional and semi-professional leagues. The FIVB Volleyball Championship is the world's largest volleyball competition. The event is held every four years and involves 24 countries.
